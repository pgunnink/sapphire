    If one wants to reconstruct trace observables from existing data some
    caveats apply. If the station applied the Mean Filter the trace values
    will no longer match the raw values used to determine the observables
    on the station. Additionally, if data reduction was active the trace
    may be missing samples without a significant signal, this complicates
    the determination of the baseline. Moreover, data reduction uses the
    ADC_BASELINE_THRESHOLD to determine what signals to keep, so tiny pulses
    may be removed making it impossible to reconstruct tiny pulseheights.

    The (default) value of ADC_BASELINE_THRESHOLD is different for the
    HiSPARC DAQ prior to v4 and also for PySPARC. Those use 25 ADC as
    threshold.

    4 traces the list is padded with the code for missing detectors: -1.
