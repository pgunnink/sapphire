""" Add more local JSON and TSV data

Add additional local data, to be used by :mod:`~sapphire.api` if internet is
unavailable. The use of local data can also be forced to skip calls to the
server or prevented to require fresh data from the server.

This data is not included by default because then the SAPPHiRE package would
become to large. By running this script the data is added after installation.
This script downloads approximately 100 MB of data.

This can be run by simply running the installed script from the command line::

    $ extend_local_data

To make the script show information about what it will do add the help flag::

    $ extend_local_data --help
